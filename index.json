CSP nonces enable websites to allow the execution of specific inline scripts and styles without relying on a whitelist. In this study, we measure and analyze the use of CSP nonces in the wild, specifically looking for nonce reuse, short nonces, and invalid nonces. We find that, of the 2271 sites that deploy a nonce-based policy, 598 of them reuse the same nonce value in more than one response, potentially enabling attackers to bypass protection offered by the CSP against XSS attacks. We analyze the causes of the nonce reuses to identify whether they are introduced by the server-side code or if the nonces are being cached by web caches. Moreover, we investigate whether nonces are only reused within the same session or for different sessions, as this impacts the effectiveness of CSP in preventing XSS attacks. Finally, we discuss the possibilities for attackers to bypass the CSP and achieve XSS in different nonce reuse scenarios.","tags":["web security","CSP","CSP nonces","web caches","large-scale analysis"],"title":"The Nonce-nce of Web Security: An Investigation of CSP Nonces Reuse","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matteo Golinelli","Elham Arshad","Dmytro Kashchuk","Bruno Crispo"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1692870569,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1692870569,"objectID":"a6a03c8e0dd1e63ed4aea3f2b41706af","permalink":"https://CybersecurityUnitn.github.io/publication/mind-the-cors/","publishdate":"2023-08-24T11:49:29+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/mind-the-cors/","section":"publication","summary":"Coming soon","tags":["CORS","SOP","cross-site requests","cross-origin","cache poisoning","web security"],"title":"Mind the CORS","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Seyed Ali Mirheidari","Matteo Golinelli","Kaan Onarlioglu","Engin Kirda","Bruno Crispo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1660089600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660089600,"objectID":"6fc062803b83f12d1a87b3d1372d65e1","permalink":"https://CybersecurityUnitn.github.io/publication/wcde/","publishdate":"2022-05-06T17:40:06+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/wcde/","section":"publication","summary":"Web Cache Deception (WCD) tricks a web cache into erroneously storing sensitive content, thereby making it widely accessible on the Internet. In a USENIX Security 2020 paper titled \"Cached and Confused: Web Cache Deception in the Wild\", researchers presented the first systematic exploration of the attack over 340 websites. This state-of-the-art approach for WCD detection injects markers into websites and checks for leaks into caches. However, this scheme has two fundamental limitations: 1) It cannot probe websites that do not present avenues for marker injection or reflection. 2) Marker setup is a burdensome process, making large-scale measurements infeasible. More generally, all previous literature on WCD focuses solely on personal information leaks on websites protected behind authentication gates, leaving important gaps in our understanding of the full ramifications of WCD. We expand our knowledge of WCD attacks, their spread, and implications. We propose a novel WCD detection methodology that forgoes testing prerequisites, and utilizes page identicality checks and cache header heuristics to test any website. We conduct a comparative experiment on 404 websites, and show that our scheme identifies over 100 vulnerabilities while \"Cached and Confused\" is capped at 18. Equipped with a technique unhindered by the limitations of the previous work, we conduct the largest WCD experiment to date on the Alexa Top 10K, and detect 1188 vulnerable websites. We present case studies showing that WCD has consequences well beyond personal information leaks, and that attacks targeting non-authenticated pages are highly damaging.","tags":["web security","web cache deception","web caches","cache poisoning"],"title":"Web Cache Deception Escalates!","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michele Grisafi","Mahmoud Ammar","Marco Roveri","Bruno Crispo"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1659312000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652447708,"objectID":"b03ef5e342f39d550efc89563d6d6b3b","permalink":"https://CybersecurityUnitn.github.io/publication/277124/","publishdate":"2022-05-13T13:15:08.010311Z","relpermalink":"/publication/277124/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"PISTIS: Trusted Computing Architecture for Low-end Embedded Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Majid Salehi","Luca Degani","Marco Roveri","Daniel Hughes","Bruno Crispo"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652446802,"objectID":"0e30c9740054f5ed4e04d40d1dfdf117","permalink":"https://CybersecurityUnitn.github.io/publication/9707846/","publishdate":"2022-05-13T13:00:02.046733Z","relpermalink":"/publication/9707846/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Discovery and Identification of Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities on Bare-metal Embedded Devices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luca Degani","Francesco Bergadano","Seyed Ali Mirheidari","Fabio Martinelli","Bruno Crispo"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652446578,"objectID":"fcba78a59e0479a54f8a8f47b16b9c05","permalink":"https://CybersecurityUnitn.github.io/publication/10-1145-3477314-3506967/","publishdate":"2022-05-13T12:56:18.041069Z","relpermalink":"/publication/10-1145-3477314-3506967/","section":"publication","summary":"Subdomain enumeration is a fundamental step of many security processes (i.e., vulnerability discovery, OSINT, host enumeration, etc.). Up to now, this has been achieved with deterministic procedures that have shown some limitations. For instance, the process typically requires the generation of a candidate, which is subsequently checked for validity. While the validation is a straightforward procedure, the definition of an optimal candidate generation strategy is still an open problem. This paper presents a novel subdomain enumeration tool that allows the generation of high-quality sub-domain candidates. We employ a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to sample unseen candidates from the distribution of valid subdomain names. The model learns this distribution from publicly available datasets. Moreover, by sampling from the trained model, we address the limitations of traditional algorithms. Our experiments were carried out against 15 domains and a ground truth of 1164 other targets. The 15 domains were carefully selected from bug bounty platforms to avoid terms of use violations. Several factors influenced the choices, including the popularity, the expected number of subdomains, and the available services. Our experiments aim to validate our approach by testing the performance increase in subdomain enumeration processes against the state-of-the-art. We benchmark our proposal in terms of candidates' validity and sample uniqueness. The results showed that, with our GAN, the performance of a traditional subdomain enumeration workflow increased by up to 61%. In addition, according to our ground truth experiments, the GAN was able to guess, on average, 32% of subdomains.","tags":["subdomain enumeration","subdomain takeover","generative adversarial networks"],"title":"Generative Adversarial Networks for Subdomain Enumeration","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://CybersecurityUnitn.github.io/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://CybersecurityUnitn.github.io/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
